# Adds a dummy implementation for unsupported platforms. This is useful when
# developing platform-independent code that doesn't absolutely need xattr
# support.
#
# You can disable this feature if you want compilation to fail on unsupported
# platforms. This would make sense if you absolutely need xattr support.
