description = "A Rust implementation of a TAR file reader and writer. This library does not\ncurrently handle compression, but it is abstract over all I/O readers and\nwriters. Additionally, great lengths are taken to ensure that the entire\ncontents are never required to be entirely resident in memory all at once.\n"
