Highlights
----------

- Generic 1, 2, ..., *n*-dimensional arrays
- Owned arrays and array views
- Slicing, also with arbitrary step size, and negative indices to mean
  elements from the end of the axis.
- Views and subviews of arrays; iterators that yield subviews.

Status and Lookout
------------------

- Still iterating on and evolving the crate

  + The crate is continuously developing, and breaking changes are expected
    during evolution from version to version. We adopt the newest stable
    rust features if we need them.

- Performance:

  + Prefer higher order methods and arithmetic operations on arrays first,
    then iteration, and as a last priority using indexed algorithms.
  + Efficient floating point matrix multiplication even for very large
    matrices; can optionally use BLAS to improve it further.

Crate Feature Flags
-------------------

The following crate feature flags are available. They are configured in
your `Cargo.toml`.

- ``rustc-serialize``

  - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enables serialization support for rustc-serialize 0.3

- ``serde-1``

  - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enables serialization support for serde 1.0

- ``blas``

  - Optional and experimental, compatible with Rust stable
  - Enable transparent BLAS support for matrix multiplication.
    Uses ``blas-sys`` for pluggable backend, which needs to be configured
    separately.

How to use with cargo
---------------------

::

    [dependencies]
    ndarray = "0.10.0"

How to enable blas integration. Depend on ``blas-sys`` directly to pick a blas
provider. Note that only end-user projects (not libraries) should select
provider::


    [dependencies]
    ndarray = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["blas"] }
    blas-sys = { version = "0.6", default-features = false, features = ["openblas"] }

__ https://bluss.github.io//rust/2017/04/09/ndarray-0.9/

- 0.8.4

  - Use ``Zip`` in ``.all_close()`` (performance improvement)
  - Use ``#[inline]`` on a function used for higher dimensional checked
    indexing (performance improvement for arrays of ndim >= 3)
  - ``.subview()`` has a more elaborate panic message

  - Fix a bug in ``Zip`` / ``NdProducer`` if an array of at least 3 dimensions
    was contig but not c- nor f-contig.
  - ``WholeChunksIter/Mut`` now impl ``Send/Sync`` as appropriate
  - Misc cleanup and using dimension-reducing versions of inner_iter
    internally. Remove a special case in ``zip_mut_with`` that only made it
    slower (1D not-contig arrays).

- 0.8.2

  - Add more documentation and an example for dynamic dimensions: see
    `IxDyn`__. ``IxDyn`` will have a representation change next incompatible
    version. Use it as a type alias for best forward compatibility.
  - Add iterable and producer ``.whole_chunks_mut(size)``.
  - Fix a bug in ``whole_chunks``: it didn't check the dimensionality of the
    requested chunk size properly (an ``IxDyn``-only bug).
  - Improve performance of ``zip_mut_with`` (and thus all binary operators) for
    block slices of row major arrays.
  - ``AxisChunksIter`` creation sped up and it implements ``Clone``.
  - Dimension mismatch in ``Zip`` has a better panic message.

  __ https://bluss.github.io/rust-ndarray/master/ndarray/type.IxDyn.html

- 0.8.1

  - Add ``Zip`` and macro ``azip!()`` which implement lock step function
    application across elements from one up to six arrays (or in general
    producers)

    + Apart from array views, axis iterators and the whole chunks iterable are
      also producers

  - Add constructor ``Array::uninitialized``
  - Add iterable and producer ``.whole_chunks(size)``
  - Implement a prettier ``Debug`` for ``Si``.
  - Fix ``Array::default`` so that it panics as documented if the size of the
    array would wrap around integer type limits.
  - Output more verbose panics for errors when slicing arrays (only in debug
    mode).

- 0.8.0

  - Remove deprecated type alias ``OwnedArray`` (use ``Array``)
  - Remove deprecated ``.assign_scalar()`` (use ``fill``)

- 0.7.3

  - Add macro `array![]` for creating one-, two-, or three-dimensional arrays
    (with ownership semantics like `vec![]`)

    allocation is (possibly) reused.
  - Add `.to_vec()` for one-dimensional arrays
  - Add `RcArray::into_owned(self) -> Array`.
  - Add crate categories

- 0.7.2

  - Add array methods ``.remove_axis()``, ``.merge_axes()`` and ``.invert_axis()``
  - Rename ``Axis``’ accessor ``axis`` to ``index``, old name is deprecated.

- 0.7.1

  - Fix two bugs in ``Array::clone()``; it did not support zero-size elements
    like ``()``, and for some negatively strided arrays it did not update the
    first element offset correctly.
  - Add ``.axes()`` which is an iterator over the axes of an array, yielding
    its index, length and stride.
  - Add method ``.max_stride_axis()``.

- 0.6.10

  - Fix two bugs in ``Array::clone()``; it did not support zero-size elements
    like ``()``, and for some negatively strided arrays it did not update the
    first element offset correctly.

- 0.7.0

  - Big overhaul of dimensions: Add type ``Dim`` with aliases
    ``Ix1, Ix2, Ix3, ...`` etc for specific dimensionalities.
    Instead of ``Ix`` for dimension use ``Ix1``, instead of ``(Ix, Ix)`` use
    ``Ix2``, and so on.
  - The dimension type ``Dim`` supports indexing and arithmetic. See
    ``Dimension`` trait for new methods and inherited traits.
  - Constructors and methods that take tuples for array sizes, like ``Array::zeros,``
    ``Array::from_shape_vec``, ``.into_shape()`` and so on will continue to work
    with tuples.
  - The array method ``.raw_dim()`` returns the shape description
    ``D`` as it is. ``.dim()`` continues to return the dimension as a tuple.
  - Renamed iterators for consistency (each iterator is named for the
    method that creates it, for example ``.iter()`` returns ``Iter``).
  - The index iterator is now created with free functions ``indices`` or
    ``indices_of``.
  - Expanded the ``ndarray::prelude`` module with the dimensionality-specific
    type aliases, and some other items
  - ``LinalgScalar`` and related features no longer need to use ``Any`` for
    static type dispatch.
  - Serialization with ``serde`` now supports binary encoders like bincode
    and others.
  - ``.assign_scalar()`` was deprecated and replaced by ``.fill()``, which
    takes an element by value.
  - Require Rust 1.13

- 0.6.9

  - Implement ``ExactSizeIterator`` for the indexed iterators

- 0.6.8

  - Fix a bug in a partially consumed elements iterator's ``.fold()``.
    (**Note** that users are recommended to not use the elements iterator,
    but the higher level functions which are the maps, folds and other methods
    of the array types themselves.)

- 0.6.7

  - Improve performance of a lot of basic operations for arrays where
    the innermost dimension is not contiguous (``.fold(), .map(),
    .to_owned()``, arithmetic operations with scalars).
  - Require Rust 1.11

- 0.6.6

  - Add dimensionality specific type aliases: ``Array0, Array1, Array2, ...``
    and so on (there are many), also ``Ix0, Ix1, Ix2, ...``.

- 0.6.1

  - Add ``unsafe`` array view constructors ``ArrayView::from_shape_ptr``
    for read-only and read-write array views. These make it easier to
    create views from raw pointers.

- 0.6.0

  - Rename ``OwnedArray`` to ``Array``. The old name is deprecated.
  - Remove deprecated constructor methods. Use zeros, from_elem, from_shape_vec
    or from_shape_vec_unchecked instead.

- 0.5.1

  - Fix theoretical well-formedness issue with Data trait

- 0.5.0

  - Require Rust 1.8 and enable +=, -=, and the other assign operators.
    All ``iadd, iadd_scalar`` and similar methods are now deprecated.
  - ndarray now has a prelude: ``use ndarray::prelude::*;``.
  - Constructors from_elem, zeros, from_shape_vec now all support passing a custom
    memory layout. A lot of specific constructors were deprecated.
  - Add method ``.select(Axis, &[Ix]) -> OwnedArray``, to create an array
    from a non-contiguous pick of subviews along an axis.
  - Rename ``.mat_mul()`` to just ``.dot()`` and add a function ``general_mat_mul``
    for matrix multiplication with scaling into an existing array.
  - **Change .fold() to use arbitrary order.**
  - See below for more details

- 0.5.0-alpha.2

  - Fix a namespace bug in the stack![] macro.

  - Implement .into_shape() for f-order arrays

- 0.5.0-alpha.0

  - Requires Rust 1.8. Compound assignment operators are now enabled by default.

    dot product and matrix multiplication.
  - Remove deprecated items: raw_data, raw_data_mut, allclose, zeros, Array.
    Docs for 0.4. lists the replacements.
  - Remove deprecated crate features: rblas, assign_ops
  - A few consuming arithmetic ops with ArrayViewMut were removed (this
    was missed in the last version).
  - **Change .fold() to use arbitrary order.** Its specification and
    implementation has changed, to pick the most appropriate element traversal
    order depending on memory layout.

- 0.4.8

  - Fix an error in ``.dot()`` when using BLAS and arrays with negative stride.

- 0.4.7

  - Add dependency matrixmultiply to handle matrix multiplication
    for floating point elements. It supports matrices of general stride
    and is a great improvement for performance. See PR #175.

- 0.4.6

  - Fix bug with crate feature blas; it would not compute matrix
    multiplication correctly for arrays with negative or zero stride.
  - Update blas-sys version (optional dependency).

- 0.4.5

  - Add ``.all_close()`` which replaces the now deprecated ``.allclose()``.
    The new method has a stricter protocol: it panics if the array
    shapes are not compatible. We don't want errors to pass silently.
  - Add a new illustration to the doc for ``.axis_iter()``.
  - Rename ``OuterIter, OuterIterMut`` to ``AxisIter, AxisIterMut``.
    The old name is now deprecated.

    (selected with crate feature ``blas``). Uses pluggable backend.
  - Deprecate module ``ndarray::blas`` and crate feature ``rblas``. This module
    was moved to the crate ``ndarray-rblas``.
  - Add array methods ``as_slice_memory_order, as_slice_memory_order_mut, as_ptr,
    as_mut_ptr``.

  - Performance improvements for contiguous arrays in non-c order when using
    methods ``to_owned, map, scalar_sum, assign_scalar``,
    and arithmetic operations between array and scalar.
  - Some methods now return arrays in the same memory order of the input
    if the input is contiguous: ``to_owned, map, mat_mul`` (matrix multiplication
    only if both inputs are the same memory order), and arithmetic operations
    that allocate a new result.
  - Slight performance improvements in ``dot, mat_mul`` due to more efficient
    glue code for calling BLAS.
  - Performance improvements in ``.assign_scalar``.

- 0.4.1

  - Mark iterators ``Send + Sync`` when possible.

- **0.4.0** `Release Announcement`__

  - New array splitting via ``.split_at(Axis, Ix)`` and ``.axis_chunks_iter()``
  - Added traits ``NdFloat``, ``AsArray`` and ``From for ArrayView`` which
    improve generic programming.
  - Array constructors panic when attempting to create an array whose element
    count overflows ``usize``. (Would be a debug assertion for overflow before.)
  - Performance improvements for ``.map()``.
  - Added ``stack`` and macro ``stack![axis, arrays..]`` to concatenate arrays.
  - Added constructor ``OwnedArray::range(start, end, step)``.
  - The type alias ``Array`` was renamed to ``RcArray`` (and the old name deprecated).
  - Binary operators are not defined when consuming a mutable array view as
    the left hand side argument anymore.
  - Remove methods and items deprecated since 0.3 or earlier; deprecated methods
    have notes about replacements in 0.3 docs.
  - See below for full changelog through alphas.

__ http://bluss.github.io/rust/2016/03/06/ndarray-0.4/

- 0.4.0-alpha.8

  - In debug mode, indexing an array out of bounds now has a detailed
    message about index and shape. (In release mode it does not.)
  - Enable assign_ops feature automatically when it is supported (Rust 1.8 beta
    or later).
  - Add trait ``NdFloat`` which makes it easy to be generic over ``f32, f64``.
  - Add ``From`` implementations that convert slices or references to arrays
    into array views. This replaces ``from_slice`` from a previous alpha.
  - Add ``AsArray`` trait, which is simply based on those ``From`` implementations.
  - Improve ``.map()`` so that it can autovectorize.
  - Use ``Axis`` argument in ``RemoveAxis`` too.
  - Require ``DataOwned`` in the raw data methods.
  - Merged error types into a single ``ShapeError``, which uses no allocated data.

- 0.4.0-alpha.7

  - Fix too strict lifetime bound in arithmetic operations like ``&a @ &b``.
  - Rename trait Scalar to ScalarOperand (and improve its docs).
  - Implement <<= and >>= for arrays.

- 0.4.0-alpha.6

  - All axis arguments must now be wrapped in newtype ``Axis``.
  - Add method ``.split_at(Axis, Ix)`` to read-only and read-write array views.
  - Add constructors ``ArrayView{,Mut}::from_slice`` and array view methods
    are now visible in the docs.

- 0.4.0-alpha.5

  - Use new trait ``LinalgScalar`` for operations where we want type-based specialization.
    This shrinks the set of types that allow dot product, matrix multiply, mean.
  - Use BLAS acceleration transparently in ``.dot()`` (this is the first step).
  - Only OwnedArray and RcArray and not ArrayViewMut can now be used as consumed
    left hand operand for arithmetic operators. `See arithmetic operations docs!`__
  - Remove deprecated module ``linalg`` (it was already mostly empty)
  - Deprecate free function ``zeros`` in favour of static method ``zeros``.

__ https://bluss.github.io/rust-ndarray/master/ndarray/struct.ArrayBase.html#arithmetic-operations

- 0.4.0-alpha.4

  - Rename ``Array`` to ``RcArray``. Old name is deprecated.
  - Add methods ``OuterIter::split_at``, ``OuterIterMut::split_at``

- 0.4.0-alpha.2

  - Add ``ArrayBase::reversed_axes`` which transposes an array.

- 0.4.0-alpha.1

  - Add checked and unchecked constructor methods for creating arrays
    from a vector and explicit dimension and stride, or with
    fortran (column major) memory order (marked ``f``):
    
    + ``ArrayBase::from_vec_dim``, ``from_vec_dim_stride``,
      ``from_vec_dim_stride_unchecked``,
    + ``from_vec_dim_unchecked_f``, ``from_elem_f``, ``zeros_f``
    + View constructors ``ArrayView::from_slice_dim_stride``,
      ``ArrayViewMut::from_slice_dim_stride``.
    + Rename old ``ArrayBase::from_vec_dim`` to ``from_vec_dim_unchecked``.

  - Check better for wraparound when computing the number of elements in a shape;
    this adds error cases that **panic** in ``from_elem``, ``zeros`` etc,
    however *the new check will only ever panic in cases that would
    trigger debug assertions for overflow in the previous versions*!.
  - Add an array chunks iterator ``.axis_chunks_iter()`` and mutable version;
    it allows traversing the array in for example chunks of *n* rows at a time.

    (affects all binary operations).
  - Add ``.row(i), .column(i)`` for 2D arrays.
  - Deprecate ``.row_iter(), .col_iter()``.
  - Add method ``.dot()`` for computing the dot product between two 1D arrays.

  - Add ``ArrayBase::linspace``, deprecate constructor ``range``.

- 0.2.0-alpha.5

  - Add ``s![...]``, a slice argument macro.
  - Add ``aview_mut1()``, ``zeros()``
  - Add ``.diag_mut()`` and deprecate ``.diag_iter_mut()``, ``.sub_iter_mut()``
  - Add ``.uget()``, ``.uget_mut()`` for unchecked indexing and deprecate the
    old names.
  - Improve ``ArrayBase::from_elem``
  - Removed ``SliceRange``, replaced by ``From`` impls for ``Si``.

- 0.2.0-alpha.4

  - Slicing methods like ``.slice()`` now take a fixed size array of ``Si``
    as the slice description. This allows more type checking to verify that the
    number of axes is correct.
  - Add experimental ``rblas`` integration.
  - Add ``into_shape()`` which allows reshaping any array or view kind.

- 0.2.0-alpha.3

  - Add and edit a lot of documentation

- 0.2.0-alpha.2

  - Improve performance for iterators when the array data is in the default
    memory layout. The iterator then wraps the default slice iterator and
    loops will autovectorize.
  - Remove method ``.indexed()`` on iterators. Changed ``Indexed`` and added
    ``ÌndexedMut``.
  - Added ``.as_slice(), .as_mut_slice()``
  - Support rustc-serialize


- 0.2.0-alpha

  - Alpha release!
  - Introduce ``ArrayBase``, ``OwnedArray``, ``ArrayView``, ``ArrayViewMut``
  - All arithmetic operations should accept any array type
  - ``Array`` continues to refer to the default reference counted copy on write
    array
  - Add ``.view()``, ``.view_mut()``, ``.to_owned()``, ``.into_shared()``
  - Add ``.slice_mut()``, ``.subview_mut()``
  - Some operations now return ``OwnedArray``:

    - ``.map()``
    - ``.sum()``
    - ``.mean()``

  - Add ``get``, ``get_mut`` to replace the now deprecated ``at``, ``at_mut``.
  - Fix bug in assign_scalar

- 0.1.1

  - Add Array::default
  - Fix bug in raw_data_mut

- 0.1.0

  - First release on crates.io
  - Starting point for evolution to come
