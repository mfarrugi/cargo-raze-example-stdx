#![doc(html_root_url = "https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.10/")]

//! The `ndarray` crate provides an *n*-dimensional container for general elements
//! and for numerics.
//!
//! In *n*-dimensional we include for example 1-dimensional rows or columns,
//! 2-dimensional matrices, and higher dimensional arrays. If the array has *n*
//! dimensions, then an element in the array is accessed by using that many indices.
//! Each dimension is also called an *axis*.
//!
//! - **[`ArrayBase`](struct.ArrayBase.html)**:
//!   The *n*-dimensional array type itself.<br>
//!   It is used to implement both the owned arrays and the views; see its docs
//!   for an overview of all array features.<br>
//! - The main specific array type is **[`Array`](type.Array.html)**, which owns
//! its elements.
//!
//! ## Highlights
//!
//! - Generic *n*-dimensional array
//! - Slicing, also with arbitrary step size, and negative indices to mean
//!   elements from the end of the axis.
//! - Views and subviews of arrays; iterators that yield subviews.
//! - Higher order operations and arithmetic are performant
//! - Array views can be used to slice and mutate any `[T]` data using
//!   `ArrayView::from` and `ArrayViewMut::from`.
//! - `Zip` for lock step function application across two or more arrays or other
//!   item producers (`NdProducer` trait).
//!
//! ## Crate Status
//!
//! - Still iterating on and evolving the crate
//!   + The crate is continuously developing, and breaking changes are expected
//!     during evolution from version to version. We adopt the newest stable
//!     rust features if we need them.
//! - Performance:
//!   + Prefer higher order methods and arithmetic operations on arrays first,
//!     then iteration, and as a last priority using indexed algorithms.
//!   + The higher order functions like ``.map()``, ``.map_inplace()``, 
//!     ``.zip_mut_with()``, ``Zip`` and ``azip!()`` are the most efficient ways
//!     to perform single traversal and lock step traversal respectively.
//!   + Performance of an operation depends on the memory layout of the array
//!     or array view. Especially if it's a binary operation, which
//!     needs matching memory layout to be efficient (with some exceptions).
//!   + Efficient floating point matrix multiplication even for very large
//!     matrices; can optionally use BLAS to improve it further.
//!   + See also the [`ndarray-parallel`] crate for integration with rayon.
//! - **Requires Rust 1.18**
//!
//! [`ndarray-parallel`]: https://docs.rs/ndarray-parallel
//!
//! ## Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available. They are configured in your
//! `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! - `rustc-serialize`
//!   - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enables serialization support for rustc-serialize 0.3
//! - `serde-1`
//!   - Optional, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enables serialization support for serde 1.0
//! - `blas`
//!   - Optional and experimental, compatible with Rust stable
//!   - Enable transparent BLAS support for matrix multiplication.
//!     Uses ``blas-sys`` for pluggable backend, which needs to be configured
//!     separately.
//!

///
/// ## `Array`
///
/// [`Array`](type.Array.html) is an owned array that ows the underlying array
/// elements directly (just like a `Vec`) and it is the default way to create and
/// store n-dimensional data. `Array<A, D>` has two type parameters: `A` for
/// the element type, and `D` for the dimensionality. A particular
/// dimensionality's type alias like `Array3<A>` just has the type parameter
/// `A` for element type.
///
/// An example:
///
/// ```
/// // Create a three-dimensional f64 array, initialized with zeros
/// use ndarray::Array3;
/// let mut temperature = Array3::<f64>::zeros((3, 4, 5));
/// // Increase the temperature in this location
/// temperature[[2, 2, 2]] += 0.5;
/// ```
///
/// ## `RcArray`
///
/// [`RcArray`](type.RcArray.html) is an owned array with reference counted
/// data (shared ownership).
/// Sharing requires that it uses copy-on-write for mutable operations.
/// Calling a method for mutating elements on `RcArray`, for example
/// [`view_mut()`](#method.view_mut) or [`get_mut()`](#method.get_mut),
/// will break sharing and require a clone of the data (if it is not uniquely held).
///
/// ## Array Views
///
/// [`ArrayView`] and [`ArrayViewMut`] are read-only and read-write array views
/// respectively. They use dimensionality, indexing, and almost all other
/// methods the same was as the other array types.
///
/// Methods for `ArrayBase` apply to array views too, when the trait bounds
/// allow.
///
/// Please see the documentation for the respective array view for an overview
/// of methods specific to array views: [`ArrayView`], [`ArrayViewMut`].
///
/// A view is created from an array using `.view()`, `.view_mut()`, using
/// slicing (`.slice()`, `.slice_mut()`) or from one of the many iterators
/// that yield array views.
///
/// You can also create an array view from a regular slice of data not
/// allocated with `Array` — see array view methods or their `From` impls.
///
/// Note that all `ArrayBase` variants can change their view (slicing) of the
/// data freely, even when their data can’t be mutated.
///
/// ## Indexing and Dimension
///
/// The dimensionality of the array determines the number of *axes*, for example
/// a 2D array has two axes. These are listed in “big endian” order, so that
/// the greatest dimension is listed first, the lowest dimension with the most
/// rapidly varying index is the last.
///
/// In a 2D array the index of each element is `[row, column]` as seen in this
/// 4 × 3 example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// [[ [0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2] ],  // row 0
///  [ [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2] ],  // row 1
///  [ [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2] ],  // row 2
///  [ [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2] ]]  // row 3
/// //    \       \       \
/// //   column 0  \     column 2
/// //            column 1
/// ```
///
/// The number of axes for an array is fixed by its `D` type parameter: `Ix1`
/// for a 1D array, `Ix2` for a 2D array etc. The dimension type `IxDyn` allows
/// a dynamic number of axes.
///
/// A fixed size array (`[usize; N]`) of the corresponding dimensionality is
/// used to index the `Array`, making the syntax `array[[` i, j,  ...`]]`
///
/// ```
/// use ndarray::Array2;
/// let mut array = Array2::zeros((4, 3));
/// array[[1, 1]] = 7;
/// ```
///
/// Important traits and types for dimension and indexing:
///
/// - A [`Dim`](Dim.t.html) value represents a dimensionality or index.
/// - Trait [`Dimension`](Dimension.t.html) is implemented by all
/// dimensionalities. It defines many operations for dimensions and indices.
/// - Trait [`IntoDimension`](IntoDimension.t.html) is used to convert into a
/// `Dim` value.
/// - Trait [`ShapeBuilder`](ShapeBuilder.t.html) is an extension of
/// `IntoDimension` and is used when constructing an array. A shape describes
/// not just the extent of each axis but also their strides.
/// - Trait [`NdIndex`](NdIndex.t.html) is an extension of `Dimension` and is
/// for values that can be used with indexing syntax.
///
///
/// The default memory order of an array is *row major* order (a.k.a “c” order),
/// where each row is contiguous in memory.
/// A *column major* (a.k.a. “f” or fortran) memory order array has
/// columns (or, in general, the outermost axis) with contiguous elements.
///
/// The logical order of any array’s elements is the row major order 
/// (the rightmost index is varying the fastest).
/// The iterators `.iter(), .iter_mut()` always adhere to this order, for example.
///
/// ## Loops, Producers and Iterators
///
/// Using [`Zip`](struct.Zip.html) is the most general way to apply a procedure
/// across one or several arrays or *producers*.
///
/// [`NdProducer`](trait.NdProducer.html) is like an iterable but for
/// multidimensional data. All producers have dimensions and axes, like an
/// array view, and they can be split and used with parallelization using `Zip`.
///
/// For example, `ArrayView<A, D>` is a producer, it has the same dimensions
/// as the array view and for each iteration it produces a reference to
/// the array element (`&A` in this case).
///
/// Another example, if we have a 10 × 10 array and use `.exact_chunks((2, 2))`
/// we get a producer of chunks which has the dimensions 5 × 5 (because
/// there are *10 / 2 = 5* chunks in either direction). The 5 × 5 chunks producer
/// can be paired with any other producers of the same dimension with `Zip`, for
/// example 5 × 5 arrays.
///
/// ### `.iter()` and `.iter_mut()`
///
/// These are the element iterators of arrays and they produce an element
/// sequence in the logical order of the array, that means that the elements
/// will be visited in the sequence that corresponds to increasing the 
/// last index first: *0, ..., 0,  0*; *0, ..., 0, 1*; *0, ...0, 2* and so on.
///
/// ### `.outer_iter()` and `.axis_iter()`
///
/// These iterators produce array views of one smaller dimension.
///
/// For example, for a 2D array, `.outer_iter()` will produce the 1D rows.
/// For a 3D array, `.outer_iter()` produces 2D subviews.
///
/// `.axis_iter()` is like `outer_iter()` but allows you to pick which
/// axis to traverse.
///
/// The `outer_iter` and `axis_iter` are one dimensional producers.
/// 
/// ## `.genrows()`, `.gencolumns()` and `.lanes()`
///
/// [`.genrows()`][gr] is a producer (and iterable) of all rows in an array.
///
/// ```
/// use ndarray::Array;
///
/// // 1. Loop over the rows of a 2D array
/// let mut a = Array::zeros((10, 10));
/// for mut row in a.genrows_mut() {
///     row.fill(1.);
/// }
///
/// // 2. Use Zip to pair each row in 2D `a` with elements in 1D `b`
/// use ndarray::Zip;
/// let mut b = Array::zeros(a.rows());
///
/// Zip::from(a.genrows())
///     .and(&mut b)
///     .apply(|a_row, b_elt| {
///         *b_elt = a_row[a.cols() - 1] - a_row[0];
///     });
/// ```
///
/// The *lanes* of an array are 1D segments along an axis and when pointed
/// along the last axis they are *rows*, when pointed along the first axis
/// they are *columns*.
///
/// A *m* × *n* array has *m* rows each of length *n* and conversely
/// *n* columns each of length *m*.
///
/// To generalize this, we say that an array of dimension *a* × *m* × *n*
/// has *a m* rows. It's composed of *a* times the previous array, so it
/// has *a* times as many rows.
///
/// All methods: [`.genrows()`][gr], [`.genrows_mut()`][grm],
/// [`.gencolumns()`][gc], [`.gencolumns_mut()`][gcm],
/// [`.lanes(axis)`][l], [`.lanes_mut(axis)`][lm].
///
/// [gr]: #method.genrows
/// [grm]: #method.genrows_mut
/// [gc]: #method.gencolumns
/// [gcm]: #method.gencolumns_mut
/// [l]: #method.lanes
/// [lm]: #method.lanes_mut
///
/// Yes, for 2D arrays `.genrows()` and `.outer_iter()` have about the same
/// effect:
///
///  + `genrows()` is a producer with *n* - 1 dimensions of 1 dimensional items
///  + `outer_iter()` is a producer with 1 dimension of *n* - 1 dimensional items
///
/// ## Slicing
///
/// You can use slicing to create a view of a subset of the data in
/// the array. Slicing methods include `.slice()`, `.islice()`,
/// `.slice_mut()`.
///
/// The slicing argument can be passed using the macro [`s![]`](macro.s!.html),
/// which will be used in all examples. (The explicit form is a reference
/// to a fixed size array of [`Si`]; see its docs for more information.)
///
/// [`Si`]: struct.Si.html
///
/// ```
/// // import the s![] macro
/// #[macro_use(s)]
/// extern crate ndarray;
///
/// use ndarray::arr3;
///
/// fn main() {
///
/// // 2 submatrices of 2 rows with 3 elements per row, means a shape of `[2, 2, 3]`.
///
/// let a = arr3(&[[[ 1,  2,  3],     // -- 2 rows  \_
///                 [ 4,  5,  6]],    // --         /

/// //  3 columns ..../.../.../
///
/// assert_eq!(a.shape(), &[2, 2, 3]);
///
/// // Let’s create a slice with
/// //
/// // - Both of the submatrices of the greatest dimension: `..`
/// // - Only the first row in each submatrix: `0..1`
/// // - Every element in each row: `..`
///
/// let b = a.slice(s![.., 0..1, ..]);
/// // without the macro, the explicit argument is `&[S, Si(0, Some(1), 1), S]`
///
/// let c = arr3(&[[[ 1,  2,  3]],
///                [[ 7,  8,  9]]]);
/// assert_eq!(b, c);
/// assert_eq!(b.shape(), &[2, 1, 3]);
///
/// // Let’s create a slice with
/// //
/// // - Both submatrices of the greatest dimension: `..`
/// // - The last row in each submatrix: `-1..`
/// // - Row elements in reverse order: `..;-1`
/// let d = a.slice(s![.., -1.., ..;-1]);
/// let e = arr3(&[[[ 6,  5,  4]],
///                [[12, 11, 10]]]);
/// assert_eq!(d, e);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Subviews
///
/// Subview methods allow you to restrict the array view while removing
/// one axis from the array. Subview methods include `.subview()`,
/// `.isubview()`, `.subview_mut()`.
///
/// Subview takes two arguments: `axis` and `index`.
///
/// ```
/// use ndarray::{arr3, aview2, Axis};
///
/// // 2 submatrices of 2 rows with 3 elements per row, means a shape of `[2, 2, 3]`.
///
/// let a = arr3(&[[[ 1,  2,  3],    // \ axis 0, submatrix 0
///                 [ 4,  5,  6]],   // /
///                [[ 7,  8,  9],    // \ axis 0, submatrix 1
///                 [10, 11, 12]]]); // /
///         //        \
///         //         axis 2, column 0
///
/// assert_eq!(a.shape(), &[2, 2, 3]);
///
/// // Let’s take a subview along the greatest dimension (axis 0),
/// // taking submatrix 0, then submatrix 1
///
/// let sub_0 = a.subview(Axis(0), 0);
/// let sub_1 = a.subview(Axis(0), 1);
///
/// assert_eq!(sub_0, aview2(&[[ 1,  2,  3],
///                            [ 4,  5,  6]]));
/// assert_eq!(sub_1, aview2(&[[ 7,  8,  9],
///                            [10, 11, 12]]));
/// assert_eq!(sub_0.shape(), &[2, 3]);
///
/// // This is the subview picking only axis 2, column 0
/// let sub_col = a.subview(Axis(2), 0);
///
/// assert_eq!(sub_col, aview2(&[[ 1,  4],
///                              [ 7, 10]]));
/// ```
///
/// `.isubview()` modifies the view in the same way as `subview()`, but
/// since it is *in place*, it cannot remove the collapsed axis. It becomes
/// an axis of length 1.
///
/// `.outer_iter()` is an iterator of every subview along the zeroth (outer)
/// axis, while `.axis_iter()` is an iterator of every subview along a
/// specific axis.
///
/// ## Arithmetic Operations
///
/// Arrays support all arithmetic operations the same way: they apply elementwise.
///
/// Since the trait implementations are hard to overview, here is a summary.
///
/// ### Binary Operators with Two Arrays
///
/// Let `A` be an array or view of any kind. Let `B` be an array
/// with owned storage (either `Array` or `RcArray`).
/// Let `C` be an array with mutable data (either `Array`, `RcArray`
/// or `ArrayViewMut`).
/// The following combinations of operands
/// are supported for an arbitrary binary operator denoted by `@` (it can be
/// `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and so on).
///
/// - `&A @ &A` which produces a new `Array`
/// - `B @ A` which consumes `B`, updates it with the result, and returns it
/// - `B @ &A` which consumes `B`, updates it with the result, and returns it
/// - `C @= &A` which performs an arithmetic operation in place
///
/// ### Binary Operators with Array and Scalar
///
/// The trait [`ScalarOperand`](trait.ScalarOperand.html) marks types that can be used in arithmetic
/// with arrays directly. For a scalar `K` the following combinations of operands
/// are supported (scalar can be on either the left or right side, but
/// `ScalarOperand` docs has the detailed condtions).
///
/// - `&A @ K` or `K @ &A` which produces a new `Array`
/// - `B @ K` or `K @ B` which consumes `B`, updates it with the result and returns it
/// - `C @= K` which performs an arithmetic operation in place
///
/// ### Unary Operators
///
/// Let `A` be an array or view of any kind. Let `B` be an array with owned
/// storage (either `Array` or `RcArray`). The following operands are supported
/// for an arbitrary unary operator denoted by `@` (it can be `-` or `!`).
///
/// - `@&A` which produces a new `Array`
/// - `@B` which consumes `B`, updates it with the result, and returns it
///
/// ## Broadcasting
///
/// Arrays support limited *broadcasting*, where arithmetic operations with
/// array operands of different sizes can be carried out by repeating the
/// elements of the smaller dimension array. See
/// [`.broadcast()`](#method.broadcast) for a more detailed
/// description.
///
/// ```
